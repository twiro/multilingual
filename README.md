# Multilingual

Multilingual extension for [Symphony CMS][1].

**NOTE:** this branch represents the current release candidate for **version 2.0.0** of multilingual. It might need some more testing, but should run pretty stable by now. Wanna know more about this big update? Have a look [at the roadmap][2].

I'm currently working on the documentation for version 2.0.0 - you can have a look at the current state [here][3].
